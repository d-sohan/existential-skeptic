      <description>In online spaces, people generally think of efilism as a death cult obcessed with extinction of all life. It is often conflated with promortalism, which is a related term and is itself prone to misunderstanding. I consider this unfortunate. Worse still, among such people are antinatalists who are quick to disassociate themselves with efilists who they consider to be perhaps the right target of the &amp;ldquo;dangerous philosophy&amp;rdquo; label that society gives to antinatalism.</description>
