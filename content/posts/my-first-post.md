In online spaces, people generally think of _efilism_ as a death cult obsessed with extinction of all life. It is often conflated with _promortalism_, which is a related term and is itself prone to misunderstanding. I consider this unfortunate. Worse still, among such people are _antinatalists_ who are quick to disassociate themselves with efilists who they consider to be perhaps the right target of the "dangerous philosophy" label that society gives to antinatalism.

In my opinion, this attitude is misguided and even antithetical to the antinatalist cause. In this article, I'll attempt to provide a better way around these terms so that unnecessary confusion and disharmony can be avoided. My motivation is primarily because I think the word _efilism_ is quite expressive and it can be used in more meaningful ways.

The word _efil_ is literally life spelled backwards, signifying the negative stance that believers of this philosophy have towards life. I think a simpler definition which doesn't include actions needed on part of its believers, would do justice to the term. As such, I propose a surprisingly familiar definition (at least to existing efilists and antinatalists): 

> **Efilism** is the belief that sentient beings are always harmed by being brought into existence (i.e. into life).

 If we go by this definition, one can easily see that _antinatalism_ and _efilism_ are not at conflict. In fact neither is _promortalism_ as I shall later explain. Antinatalism as well as promortalism are actually _solutions_ to or conclusions of the efilist position. 

If you don't want to harm anybody and you accept that bringing sentient beings into existence harms the particular being, what do you do? Well, stop bringing beings into existence of course! Thus a morally good person who agrees with the eflist position (i.e. becomes an efilist), must become an antinatalist.

What if the deed has already been done? Let's say it was _you_ who was brought into existence and was thus harmed. What then? Well if you have come to terms with the efilist position (i.e. have become an efilist), you might want to escape at least some of the harms entailed with existence, wouldn't you? "That escape should be painless and instantenous", you demand, "and always available for cheap". That is _promortalism_- that it is best to return to non-existence in the most painless way possible. However, you come to know that the most painless way in reality is not painless enough (at least for you) and a real option to such an exit is yet to be invented, if at all, for you are also told that you are committing a great sin just by wanting to escape the pains of your life. "It's a dilemma", you exclaim. It's like waking up in a burning room without any memory and the only exit you see is up in flames!

Unlike antinatalism, promortalism is not an _if_ but a _when_ question. Also the antinatalist decision impacts somebody else, unlike promortalism. So, I think the most important philosophical question deals not with suicide but with procreation. If you are a promortalist and you do decide to exit the burning room anyways, you should not do something that causes someone else to spawn in another burning room. In other words, morally good promortalists should be antinatalists.

Thus, all antinatalists and promortalists are efilists.
